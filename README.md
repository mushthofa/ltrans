Meta-Interpretation approach for Answer Set Programs with Bounded Predicate Arities

The implementation of meta-interpreter as suggested by:
[T. Eiter, W. Faber, M. Fink, and S.Woltran. Complexity results for answer set programming
with bounded predicate arities and implications. Annals of Mathematics and Articial
Intelligence, 51(2-4):123{165, 2007. ISSN 1012-2443.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10472-008-9086-5)

and further investigated in the thesis: 
Evaluation of Answer Set Programs with Bounded Predicate Arities. TU Wien. 2009.
